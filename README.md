## Research

We decided to focus our research in hyperparameter optimization. We benchmarked different models - classical ones like manual fine-tuning and grid search, but also more uncommon ones like random search. We also benchmarked our own extended random search in this mini-project.

## Dataset and model

We decided to use a public [Heart Attack Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset)
